# Projects

Projects Using Computational tools for  Stochastical Methods. <br>
Mainly programmed in Julia and R


## SEP1
This project is about the simulation of a non-Gaussian Copula used in finances.
The main key was to follow and Algorithm in order to create the relation between variables

## SEP2
The project was about the developing of a Hamilitonian Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate multivariate distributions

## STAN Project
This project make use of STAN to simulate different time series in order to estimate solar sun spots
